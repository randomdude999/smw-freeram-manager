<romname>.ramdesc is a JSON document.

commented example document:
{
	// ram is array representing all freeram in the address space
	// this could be updated with info from new tools that hardcode their ram
	"ram": [
	{
		"addr": 0, // start address of this freeram (SNES address converted to decimal. abs/dp should assume bank 0/dp 0000)
		"len": 0, // length of this freeram
		"flags": ["sa1"] // list of flags for this freeram
	}
	],
	"claims": [
	{
		"addr": 0, // start address of the claim (SNES address converted to decimal)
		"len": 0, // length of the claim
		"identifier": "id", // a unique identifier for this freeram. if you try to allocate multiple freerams with the same ID, the first one will be returned.
		"flags": ["sa1"] // list of flags this freeram was requested with. Used to check incompatible requests with the same id
	}
	]
}

Flags:
When requesting freeram, you can specify a list of flags that said freeram must/must not have. "Must" flags don't have prefixes, "must not" flags are prefixed with "-".
I'm quite sure it's possible to handle SA-1 with this flags method.
